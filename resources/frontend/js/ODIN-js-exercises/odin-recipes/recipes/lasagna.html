  <h2>Description</h2>
    Someone else spent a great deal of time crafting this delicious recipe, and almost as long cooking it.
    <br>Myself, I just buy the frozen ones at Costco. 
    <br>Regardless of sourcing, lasagna is something of a battle of wills.
    <br>You see, I live in a studio apartment, which is really just a slightly larger oven,
    <br>from which I can't escape.
    <br>So, the question is never "Do I want lasagna?", but rather: 
    <br>"Do I want to sweat for the next 3 hours?"

  <h2>Directions:</h2>
  <br>Here lies a <strong><em>very</em></strong> brief overview of lasagna making
    <br>Make the meat sauce.
        <br>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned.
        <br>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water.
        <br>Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper.
        <br>Simmer, covered, for about 1 ½ hours, stirring occasionally.
    <br>Cook the noodles.
        <br>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes.
        <br> Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.
    <br>Make the ricotta mixture.
        <br>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.
      <br>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
    <br><h4>Layer the lasagna:</h4>
        <br>Meat sauce
          <ul>Spread 1 ½ cups of meat sauce.</ul>
        <br>Noodles
          <ul>Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce, overlapping slightly.</ul>
        <br>Ricotta mixture
          <ul>Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture.</ul>
        <br>Mozzarella slices
          <ul>Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices.</ul>
        <br>Meat sauce
          <ul>Spoon 1 ½ cups meat sauce over mozzarella.</ul>
        <br>Parmesan cheese
          <ul>Sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.</ul>
        <br>Repeat the layers, then top with the remaining Parmesan.
    <br>Cover with foil and bake.
      <ul>To prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</ul>
    <br>Let the lasagna rest before serving. You should rest, too. That was a lot of work!
